In a related analysis, I opened a `.pcap` file and noticed several SSH encrypted packets exchanged between a VM (`172.21.224.2`) and a remote IP (`35.235.244.34`), alongside various DNS queries to `opensource.google.com`.

There are some notable details we can take from this:

- Multiple TCP ACK and encrypted packets over SSH (port 22) show active secure sessions.
- DNS queries to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including responses resolving to Google’s infrastructure (e.g., `142.250.1.139`), help confirm domain resolution behavior as expected.
- No packet payloads are visible due to encryption, but TCP flags and sequence numbers allow traffic correlation, implying proper security.

**End Use Case**  
This capture illustrates the mix of background activity typical on a system: DNS resolution, encrypted SSH sessions, and standard TCP behavior—useful for baseline comparisons when hunting for anomalies, enabling us to get a proper overview of what classic packet traffic looks like through SSH and DNS being present.
