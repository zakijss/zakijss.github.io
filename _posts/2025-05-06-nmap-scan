_Basic Nmap port scan on remote IP_

Used `nmap -sV [IP]` to scan for open ports and running services. Discovered standard ports like 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

This type of scan helps detect open services, potentially misconfigured servers, and opportunities for deeper analysis.

**Use Case:** This is essential for reconnaissance during vulnerability assessments or penetration testing, especially to map a network surface before deeper probing.
