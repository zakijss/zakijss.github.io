We’re living in a strange new moment. Technology is no longer simply a tool we control, it’s something we negotiate with, something that quietly shapes the contours of daily life. Its presence is ambient, always on, always learning.

The erosion of personal privacy is often discussed in technical or legal terms, but we tend to ignore its psychological cost. Knowing that our digital lives are tracked, interpreted, and sometimes sold back to us alters how we behave. We self-censor. We perform. We internalize the gaze of systems we can’t see or understand. And over time, this begins to blur the line between authentic expression and algorithmic conformity.

This shift isn’t just external, it’s emotional, cognitive, even existential. If our private thoughts can become data, what does that mean for the idea of the self? If choices are predicted before they’re made, what happens to the feeling of agency?

These aren’t just philosophical questions. They are urgent ones, especially as younger generations grow up with a baseline assumption that privacy is conditional and consciousness is never fully alone.

This blog exists to think through these questions. Not to panic, and not to idolize the past, but to reflect clearly. We're not just witnessing change—we’re experiencing it from the inside out.

Let’s try to make sense of it.
